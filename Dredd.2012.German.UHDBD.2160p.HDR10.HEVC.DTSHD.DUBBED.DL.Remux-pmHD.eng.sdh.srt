978
01:23:18,579 --> 01:23:20,330
We're a kilometer above ground.

979
01:23:21,748 --> 01:23:24,418
What do you figure
the range is on that thing?

980
01:23:25,836 --> 01:23:27,838
Could it get through 100
levels of concrete?

981
01:23:29,256 --> 01:23:30,883
How about 200?

982
01:23:31,925 --> 01:23:33,594
Let's find out.

983
01:23:48,025 --> 01:23:51,987
Citizen Ma-Ma.
Your crimes are multiple homicide

984
01:23:52,070 --> 01:23:54,948
and the manufacture
and distribution of narcotics.

985
01:23:55,407 --> 01:23:56,783
How do you plead?

986
01:24:03,916 --> 01:24:05,167
Defense noted.

987
01:26:31,396 --> 01:26:32,439
Yeah!

988
01:27:30,580 --> 01:27:31,706
Anderson.

989
01:27:32,999 --> 01:27:34,084
PARAMEDIC: Victims first.

990
01:27:34,167 --> 01:27:36,461
Let the perps lay where they lie, huh?

991
01:27:38,755 --> 01:27:40,257
Your assessment's now over.

992
01:27:56,356 --> 01:27:57,357
ANDERSON: Sir.

993
01:28:03,989 --> 01:28:05,949
When I heard you'd called in a 10-24,

994
01:28:06,032 --> 01:28:07,617
I thought I'd better check it out.

995
01:28:07,701 --> 01:28:09,619
Seeing as I forced the rookie on you.

996
01:28:10,287 --> 01:28:12,205
So, what happened in there?

997
01:28:12,289 --> 01:28:13,623
Drug bust.

998
01:28:13,707 --> 01:28:15,625
Look like you been through it.

999
01:28:15,709 --> 01:28:17,335
Perps were uncooperative.

1000
01:28:18,378 --> 01:28:19,796
So how did she do?

1001
01:28:21,047 --> 01:28:23,216
She a pass or a fail?

1002
01:28:26,636 --> 01:28:28,180
PARAMEDIC: Let's take a look, huh?

1003
01:28:29,014 --> 01:28:30,682
She's a pass.

1004
01:28:31,975 --> 01:28:33,435
I knew she would be.

1005
01:28:38,648 --> 01:28:40,233
WOMAN: No time to waste. Let's move.

1006
01:28:40,317 --> 01:28:41,484
Tell them to go to the back

1007
01:28:41,568 --> 01:28:43,445
and we will take the front entrance.

1008
01:28:52,204 --> 01:28:54,039
DREDD: <i>Mega City One.</i>

1009
01:28:55,498 --> 01:28:56,750
<i>800 million people</i>

1010
01:28:56,833 --> 01:28:59,628
<i>living in the ruin of the old world</i>

1011
01:28:59,711 --> 01:29:02,172
<i>and the mega structures of the new one.</i>

1012
01:29:04,257 --> 01:29:07,886
<i>Only one thing
fighting for order in the chaos,</i>

1013
01:29:09,429 --> 01:29:10,764
<i>Judges.</i>
